## Specifics of Trading with Alliance Trading Group
Minimum Deposit

**Trade Volume**
Trades can range from 0.01 lots up to 100 lots per order. This range enables experienced traders to work with large volumes while allowing beginners to manage risks effectively.

**Leverage**
The maximum leverage reaches 1:100 for forex trading. This presents an opportunity for potentially high profits but requires a careful approach to risk management. For other instruments, such as stocks or cryptocurrencies, more conservative limits apply, allowing trading with a 1:1 ratio.

**Spreads**
The broker offers floating spreads, starting at approximately 0.5 pips. Their size depends on market liquidity and volatility. Due to market execution, trades are processed without requotes, which positively impacts trading quality.

**Commissions**
According to the broker’s current policies, some assets can be traded without commissions. However, where commissions do apply, they typically range from $0 to $5 per lot, depending on the asset category and the selected account type.

**Negative Balance Protection**
This feature ensures that a client’s losses do not exceed their deposited funds, which is especially crucial when trading highly volatile assets or using high leverage.

**24/7 Support**
Technical support is available on weekdays from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM (UK time). Specialists provide consultations in English and other European languages, assisting both beginners and advanced traders.

**Cryptocurrencies**
Digital assets are highly popular among Alliance Trading Group clients, offering competitive trading conditions for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies.
